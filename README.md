## INFLECT
Quality control and determination of optimal k for FlowSOM high-dimensional clustering data. Iteratively clusters and evaluates resulting clusters for marker unimodality. Translates this into a unimodality score and plots it into a diagnostic graph. On the fitted curve of this unimodality score INFLECT determines the inflection point where unimodality stops increasing for greater numbers of clusters.
